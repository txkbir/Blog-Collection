          My name is Takbir and I'm a 2nd year Computer Science student at UCLA! I am proficient in Python and C++ programming and I am learning the ropes of Fullstack Web Development.

          I am a motivated and fast learner, and I pick up on new technologies/ideas very fast. I am actively seeking a software engineering internship opportunity to apply my programming skills in creating innovative solutions that enable business and technical functions. Above all, I want to collaborate in a dynamic team, create value, contribute to meaningful projects, and grow as a software developer.

          In my free time, I love hiking, biking, watching movies, and collecting LEGO! I'm a huge Star Wars fan and have been my entire life, and as such, I pretty much only collect LEGO Star Wars. I also love cats despite being severely allergic üòÅ. One fun fact about me is that I'm ambidextrous.
